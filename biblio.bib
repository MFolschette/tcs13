  title = {Applications of a formal approach to decipher discrete genetic networks},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {11},
  pages = {385},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:A growing demand for tools to assist the building and analysis
	of biological networks exists in systems biology. We argue that the
	use of a formal approach is relevant and applicable to address questions
	raised by biologists about such networks. The behaviour of these
	systems being complex, it is essential to exploit efficiently every
	bit of experimental information. In our approach, both the evolution
	rules and the partial knowledge about the structure and the behaviour
	of the network are formalized using a common constraint-based language.RESULTS:In
	this article our formal and declarative approach is applied to three
	biological applications. The software environment that we developed
	allows to specifically address each application through a new class
	of biologically relevant queries. We show that we can describe easily
	and in a formal manner the partial knowledge about a genetic network.
	Moreover we show that this environment, based on a constraint algorithmic
	approach, offers a wide variety of functionalities, going beyond
	simple simulations, such as proof of consistency, model revision,
	prediction of properties, search for minimal models relatively to
	specified criteria.CONCLUSIONS:The formal approach proposed here
	deeply changes the way to proceed in the exploration of genetic and
	biochemical networks, first by avoiding the usual trial-and-error
	procedure, and second by placing the emphasis on sets of solutions,
	rather than a single solution arbitrarily chosen among many others.
	Last, the constraint approach promotes an integration of model and
	experimental data in a single framework.},

in today's economy and society, and their exploitation requires representation
via the development of a declarative interface whose input language is based
on logic. Chitta Baral demonstrates how to write programs that behave
intelligently by giving them the ability to express knowledge and reason about
it. He presents a language, AnsProlog, for both knowledge representation and
reasoning, and declarative problem solving. Many of the results have never
appeared before in book form but are organized here for those wishing to learn
more about the subject, either in courses or through self-study.}},
